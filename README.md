📦 Tech Stack
FlutterFlow – Visual app builder for Flutter UI

Dart – Programming language for Flutter

Firebase Authentication – User sign-up, login, and password management

Firebase Firestore – NoSQL real-time database to store tasks

Firebase Security Rules – Data validation and user access control

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Prerequisites
Flutter SDK installed (Flutter install guide)

Dart SDK included with Flutter

Firebase account with a project set up

FlutterFlow account with the app exported

2️⃣ Clone or Export the Project
Export the project from FlutterFlow or clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-flutterflow.git
cd todo-list-flutterflow
3️⃣ Connect Firebase
Create a Firebase project at Firebase Console.

Add Android and/or iOS app(s) to the Firebase project.

Download google-services.json (Android) and/or GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS) and place them in the appropriate platform folders:

Android: android/app/

iOS: ios/Runner/

Enable Authentication (Email/Password) and Firestore Database.

Set up Firebase Security Rules to allow only authenticated users to read/write their tasks.

4️⃣ Configure Flutter Project
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
flutter pub get
Run the app:

bash
Copy

🔑 Firebase Security Rules (Sample)
Here’s an example Firestore security rule for user-based access:

javascript
Copy
Edit
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /tasks/{taskId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
